The guessing project in C++ is a game designed to test the playerâ€™s luck and knowledge. The player needs to guess a random number generated by the computer. If the player guesses right, they will win a certain amount of money. The winning prize depends on the difficulty of the game. The program implements classes, functions, and user-defined data types. It also uses other features such as loops and conditionals to create a logical structure. Furthermore, it makes use of the standard template library to implement basic operations and other data structures.

Game Rules:
- Player deposits an initial amount to start playing game.
- He guesses a number between 1 to 10 and enters betting amount.
- If he wins he will get 10 times of money he bets.
- Lose if player don't have any money left.

Implementation:

- Randomize the number from 1 to 10
- if guessed the number multiply the total money by 10
